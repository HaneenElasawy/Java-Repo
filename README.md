This repository includes all labs, assignments, and mini projects for the ITI Java course.
Each folder represents a specific topic or lab, such as:
	•	Basic syntax & control flow
	•	OOP principles (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)
	•	Interfaces, abstract classes, and inner classes
	•	Collections, Generics, String & StringBuilder
	•	File I/O and exception handling

The repo is structured to make it easy to review, refactor, and reuse the code later
